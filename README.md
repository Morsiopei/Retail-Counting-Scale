# Retail-Counting-Scale
The **Retail/Domestic Counting Scale System is designed to deliver accurate, fast, and reliable counting of items for both commercial retail environments and domestic applications . This device aims to streamline inventory management, reduce human error, and support integration with broader point-of-sale (POS) and inventory management systems.

# Retail/Domestic Counting Scale System (SPEC-02)

This repository contains the firmware, backend (optional), hardware design files, and documentation for the Counting Scale System.

## Project Overview

(Describe the project goals, based on SPEC-02 Background)

## Modules

*   **`/firmware`**: Embedded C/C++ code running on the scale's microcontroller (e.g., ESP32 using ESP-IDF/Arduino).
*   **`/backend`**: Optional Python Flask backend for data logging, API access, and remote management.
*   **`/hardware`**: KiCad (or other EDA) files for schematic and PCB layout, CAD files for enclosure.
*   **`/docs`**: System documentation, API specifications, user guides.

## Setup & Usage

### Firmware

(Instructions on setting up the build environment - e.g., PlatformIO, ESP-IDF, toolchain installation, library dependencies)

```bash
# Example build command (using PlatformIO)
cd firmware
platformio run

# Example upload command
platformio run --target upload
